# ccw-plugin-eastwood

This Counterclockwise plugin integrates the Eastwood lint tool (https://github.com/jonase/eastwood) with Counterclockwise.

This plugin's state is under development.

## Install

The `~/.ccw/` folder is where Counterclockwise searches for User Plugins.

It is recommended to layout User Plugins inside this folder by mirroring Github's namespacing. So if you clone laurentpetit/ccw-plugin-eastwood, you should do the following:

- Create a folder named `~/.ccw/laurentpetit/`
- Clone this project from `~/.ccw/laurentpetit/`

        mkdir -p ~/.ccw/laurentpetit
        cd ~/.ccw/laurentpetit
        git clone https://github.com/laurentpetit/ccw-plugin-eastwood.git

- If you have already installed ccw-plugin-manager (https://github.com/laurentpetit/ccw-plugin-manager.git), then type `Alt+U S` to re[S]tart User Plugins (and thus ccw-plugin-eastwood will be found and loaded)
- If you have not already installed ccw-plugin-manager, restart your Eclipse / Counterclockwise/Standalone instance.

## Usage

Add a global Leiningen dependency to Eastwood in your `~/.lein/profiles.clj`
```clojure
echo '{:user {:plugins [[jonase/eastwood "0.2.0"]] }}' > ~/.lein/profiles.clj
```

Use `Cmd+U E` on OS X, `Ctrl+U E` on Windows/Linux when the focus is on the Package Explorer.

This will start Leiningen for the project, and run the 'eastwood' task. A console view will be created, and you'll be able to see the output from the `lein eastwood` task. The plugin will then automatically convert Eastwood hints to Eclipse Problem Markers with a `warning` severity.
